Install the required Python dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Enter a tweet in the provided text input field and click the "Analyze" button to see the sentiment analysis results.
Dependencies
streamlit: Used for creating the web app interface.
transformers: Used for loading the pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
scipy: Used for computing softmax scores.
